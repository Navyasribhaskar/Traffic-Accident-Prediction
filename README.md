# Traffic-Accident-Prediction
Predicting traffic accident severity and high-risk zones using machine learning and real-world data.

#Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Random Forest Classifier
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium for visualization

# Approach
1. Loaded and explored the US Accidents dataset.
2. Cleaned and preprocessed data (handled missing values, encoded categorical variables).
3. Extracted features such as hour, weekday, and weather conditions.
4. Trained and tested Random Forest and other ML models to predict accident severity.
5. Visualized accident hotspots on an interactive map using Folium.

# Results
- Achieved accuracy of ~85% with Random Forest model.
- Identified correlations between weather, time, and accident severity.
- Created geospatial heatmaps highlighting accident-prone zones.
